      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I am 29 years old. I am from Mexico and now live in Colorado. I studied
        Sociology at Colorado College. Currently, I work at a nonprofit as a
        Research Manager. I always wanted to do work that supported the
        communities I am a part of and I have been fortunate enough to do that.

          I contributed to the coordination of a project to create a new tool to
          message 400,000+ members through text in a more efficient manner,
