          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>
            I am 29 years old. I am from Mexico and now live in Colorado. I
            studied Sociology at Colorado College. Currently, I work at a
            nonprofit as a Research Manager. I always wanted to do work that
            supported the communities I am a part of and I have been fortunate
            enough to do that.
